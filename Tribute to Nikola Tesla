    <h2><u>BIOGRAPHY</u></h2>
    <p>Nikola Tesla (/ˈtɛslə/;[2] Serbian Cyrillic: Никола Тесла, [nǐkola têsla]; 10 July 1856[a] – 7 January 1943) was a Serbian-American[3][4] engineer, futurist, and inventor. He is known for his contributions to the design of the modern alternating current (AC) electricity supply system.</p>
    <p>Born and raised in the Austrian Empire, Tesla first studied engineering and physics in the 1870s without receiving a degree. He then gained practical experience in the early 1880s working in telephony and at Continental Edison in the new electric power industry. In 1884 he immigrated to the United States, where he became a naturalized citizen. He worked for a short time at the Edison Machine Works in New York City before he struck out on his own. With the help of partners to finance and market his ideas, Tesla set up laboratories and companies in New York to develop a range of electrical and mechanical devices. His AC induction motor and related polyphase AC patents, licensed by Westinghouse Electric in 1888, earned him a considerable amount of money and became the cornerstone of the polyphase system which that company eventually marketed.</p>
    <p>Attempting to develop inventions he could patent and market, Tesla conducted a range of experiments with mechanical oscillators/generators, electrical discharge tubes, and early X-ray imaging. He also built a wirelessly controlled boat, one of the first ever exhibited. Tesla became well known as an inventor and demonstrated his achievements to celebrities and wealthy patrons at his lab, and was noted for his showmanship at public lectures. Throughout the 1890s, Tesla pursued his ideas for wireless lighting and worldwide wireless electric power distribution in his high-voltage, high-frequency power experiments in New York and Colorado Springs. In 1893, he made pronouncements on the possibility of wireless communication with his devices. Tesla tried to put these ideas to practical use in his unfinished Wardenclyffe Tower project, an intercontinental wireless communication and power transmitter, but ran out of funding before he could complete it.</p>
    <p>After Wardenclyffe, Tesla experimented with a series of inventions in the 1910s and 1920s with varying degrees of success. Having spent most of his money, Tesla lived in a series of New York hotels, leaving behind unpaid bills. He died in New York City in January 1943.[6] Tesla's work fell into relative obscurity following his death, until 1960, when the General Conference on Weights and Measures named the International System of Units (SI) measurement of magnetic flux density the tesla in his honor. There has been a resurgence in popular interest in Tesla since the 1990s</p>

            <h2><u>ACHIEVEMENTS</u></h2>
            <ul>Nickola Tesla invented:
                <p></p>
                <li><strong>Alternating Current</strong>
                <p>One of Tesla's most significant contributions to electrical engineering was the development of alternating current (AC). Unlike direct current (DC), which only flows in one direction, alternating current constantly changes direction. This makes it possible to transmit energy more efficiently and over greater distances. Tesla's alternating current system was the decisive factor in the "Electricity War" against Edison, whose direct current system was eventually displaced by alternating current</p>
            <p>When George Westinghouse heard about Tesla's alternating current system, he immediately recognised its potential and acquired the rights to Tesla's alternating current patents for 60,000 US dollars and ongoing royalties.</p></li>

                <li><strong>Transformer and Three-phase Motor</strong>
                <p>Another of Tesla's great achievements was the invention of the transformer and the three-phase motor. The transformer allows electrical voltages to be increased or decreased, which is essential for efficient power transmission. The three-phase motor, also known as the induction motor, is one of the fundamental technologies in electrical engineering and is still used in many industries today.</p></li>

                <li><strong>Wireless energy transmission</strong>
                <p>Nikola Tesla also experimented with wireless power transmission, a technology with the ability to transmit electrical power without physical connections. His work led to the development of the Tesla coil, an electrical resonant transformer that can generate electromagnetic fields and transmit power wirelessly. This technology is still the basis for wireless charging of electronic devices today.</p>
            </li>
            <li><Strong>Tesla Coil</Strong>
            <p>A Tesla coil comprises a primary coil and secondary coil, each coil with its own capacitor to store electrical energy. A spark gap links both the coils and capacitors. The system is powered by a high-voltage source. As the current flows out of the capacitor down the primary coil, a magnetic field is created.</p></li>

            <h2><u>AWARDS</u></h2>
            <ul>In recognition of his accomplishments, Nikola Tesla received many awards and honors during his lifetime:
                <p></p>
                <li><strong>Edison Medal by the American Institute of Electrical Engineers</strong> (1917) for his contributions to the development of alternating current power systems.</li>

                <li><strong>Inventors Hall of Fame induction (1975)</strong></li>
                <li>The unit of <strong>magnetic flux density</strong> was named the "tesla" in his honor (1984).</li>
                <li>Numerous schools, buildings, and museums have been named after him to recognize his contributions to science and technology.</li>
                <p>Additionally, Nikola Tesla was awarded the 1912 <strong>Nobel Prize for Physics, together with Thomas Edison.</strong>  However, because of their feud, Tesla rejected the prize, which was then awarded to Nils Gustaf Dalén.</p>
